      <Blurb>
        <p>
          Hi there! I'm a software engineer with over 10 years of professional
          experience. I started as a self-taught coder, making webpages
          (Geocities üòç) and writing small utilities to make my IT help desk job
          easier.
        </p>

        <p>
          I broke into the industry as a tester at a small startup that
          frequently deployed and demoed its product to investors. This
          experience taught me how critical software quality is to the
          business‚Äîespecially as I observed how development practices directly
          impacted the app's reliability. To help keep up with the rapid pace of
          development (one-week sprints), I implemented extensive test
          automation, which eventually allowed me to take on development work.
          This shift gave me more control over the quality of the product.
        </p>

        <p>
          After the startup, I moved into software delivery consulting, bringing
          my experience in both development and testing. I spent my time pairing
          and mobbing with teams to implement application code while advocating
          for better testing practices‚Äîasking about potential test scenarios,
          encouraging developers to update end-to-end browser tests, and
          generally influencing how teams thought about testing as an integral
          part of development.
        </p>

        <p>
          The more I worked as both a developer and tester, the more I saw a
          deep connection between good implementation design and testability. My
          "tester spidey sense" would tingle during story refinement or while
          pairing on a feature. I had learned through experience‚Äîoften painful
          experience‚Äîhow certain design decisions could create testing
          headaches. Over time, I developed a strong intuition for spotting
          trouble before it happened, and my technical background allowed me to
          address it effectively. Being able to wear both hats at the same time
          turned out to be a major superpower.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over my career, I've worked across multiple industries, helping
          organizations design and build greenfield applications, modernize
          legacy systems, and establish best practices in development, testing,
          and delivery. My expertise spans the entire software lifecycle‚Äîfrom
          early product discussions to defining robust testing strategies,
          building automation frameworks, and mentoring teams on implementing
          scalable, testable, maintainable software.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside of work, I love writing test tools, game development, cooking,
          and synthesizers. I love to learn new things, so this list is
          constantly growing.
